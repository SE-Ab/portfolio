# Personal Portfolio Website - Abhishek Kumar Singh

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as a Full Stack Developer and Tech Trainer. It is a clean, modern, and fully responsive single-page application designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my career journey.

This project was converted from a Next.js/React concept into a pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** static site for maximum performance, portability, and ease of deployment.
